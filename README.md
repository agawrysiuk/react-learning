# react-learning

This project with React was created as a result of 
my Education Week at Altkom Software & Consulting.

To learn React, I used a 40hrs course on Udemy:

https://www.udemy.com/share/101WayBUUfcltRQno=/

If you thinking about learning React, I fully encourage you to take advantage of this course as it covers a lot of
ground rules and day-to-day frameworks that React uses, but also it's up-to-date, so it shows you the difference between
the old ways of writing React code and the new ways. Super important when you get tossed into an older project!

**Things I learnt during that week:**
- What is React
- What is included in the Next Generation JavaScript
- Components vs Containers (or Stateless vs Stateful)
- Passing values and methods with two-way binding
- Styling, Radium, Styled Components, and CSS Modules (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/)
- React Developer Tools in Google Chrome
- Error Boundaries
- Creation/Update Lifecycles https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html
- Components Lifecycle
    - `getDerivedStateFromProps()`
    - `componentDidMount()`
    - `componentWillUnmount()`
    - `shouldComponentUpdate()`
    - `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`
    - `componentDidUpdate()`
    - `PureComponent`
- Functional Components Lifecycle 
    - `useState()`
    - `useEffect()` https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html
    - `React.memo()`
- About Virtual DOM and how React updates the real DOM
- What you can return from `render()` method (Higher Order Components)
    - Higher Order Components https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html
        - JSX wrapped with root element (e.g. div) -> `return (<div></div>)`;
        - Adjacent JSX Elements (Auxiliary.js for Windows (as Aux is a reserved name), Aux.js for else),
            otherwise known as empty wrappers -> `return (<Aux>...</Aux>)` `const aux = props => props.children;` which act as a root element
        - React.Fragment -> also acts as a root element but is available since React 16.2 -> `return (<React.Fragment>...</React.Fragment>)`
        - Even newer version of React.Fragment, an empty tag that acts as a root element -> `return (<>...</>)`
        - other examples of Higher Order Components (names start with "With...") which are wrappers doing
        some work, e.g. WithClass technically is just a div with className but it can be written as:
            - a regular functional component (use when logic has something to do with HTML) 
            `const withClass = props => (<div className={props.classes}>{props.children}</div>);`
            which is used like `return (<WithClass classes={classes.Person}>...</WithClass>);`
            - or as a function (use when logic has something to do with running additional JS code)
            `const withClass = (WrappedComponent, className) => { return props => (<div className={className}><WrappedComponent {...props} /></div>);};`
            which wraps the class which is using it in the export, e.g. `export default withClass(Person, classes.Person);`
            so that way, we can set some Adjacent SJX Element as a wrapper `return (<Aux>...</Aux>)` and still have a higher wrapper with a className
    - An array of components created programmatically -> `return list.map(p -> return <P />)`;
    - An array of components/DOM objects typed -> `return [<div key="1"></div>, <p key="2"></p>, <P />]`
- PropTypes - runtime check for React props and similar objects. 
Used to document the intended types of properties passed to components. 
It checks props passed to the components against those definitions, and warn in development if they donâ€™t match.
https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html
- Refs - https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html a special property on any component which makes it detected by React. It can be used in several ways:
    - in Components
        - `<input ref={inputEl => this.inputElement = inputEl} ...?</...>`
        which can be called with `this.inputElementy.doSomething()`
        - from React 16.2, the most modern approach is to create a reference in constructor `this.inputElementRef = React.createRef();`,
        then signing it to some element `<input ref={this.inputElementRef} ...?</...>`, and finally, calling it
         by pointing to the current reference: `this.inputElementRef.current.doSomething();` in for example `componentDidMount()`
    - in Functional Components
        - by just creating a constant with React Hook `const toggleBtnRef = useRef(null);`, then
        signing it to some element `<button ref={toggleBtnRef} ...`, and finally, calling it
        by pointing to the current reference: `toggleBtnRef.current.click();` inside e.g. React Hook `useEffect()`
- Context - introduced by React and it helps us handle cases, where you need certain 
data, certain state in multiple components and you don't want to pass that state across multiple layers
of components just to get it from component A at the top to component D at the very bottom when the
components B, C in between don't really care about it. In short, Context is globally available
(or in the place you want to be available) JavaScrip object/array/variable. First, you create a js file with
the context `const yourContext = React.createContext({some: value, other: value}); export default yourContext;` (funnily enough,
we don't really care about the values here as we are going to use state) and then, there are three ways to use it:
    - as a JSX element with the syntax `<YourContext.Provider value={this.state.value}>...</...>` in the parent component where
    you set value, and the syntax `<YourContext.Consumer>{context => <child_components_here>}</...>` (function inside!) 
    in the component bottom child (in this example, we skip components B and C, and put it right into D).
    - with React 16.6, in the Components you can use a static property contextType (written exactly like this) and its value
    should match YourContext, like this: `static contextType = YourContext;`; then, you just use `this.context.value`
    (not this.contextType!) to get the values you need
    - in the Functional Components, you can use React Hook `useContext()` with the syntax `const yourContext = useContext(YourContext);`
    and then, use it inside the function by calling `yourContext.anyValueOrMethod`
- Sending Http Requests in React using Axios https://github.com/axios/axios
    - Should use `componentDidMount()` for HTTP requests
    - Using request and response interceptors for handling requests/responses and errors `axios.interceptors` https://github.com/axios/axios#interceptors
    - Using request and response interceptors in the wrapper anonymous class, withErrorHandler (with ejecting interceptors)
    - Setting up global configurations
        - Adding base URL with `axios.defaults.baseURL`
        - Adding default headers
            - For every request `axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = 'AUTH_TOKEN';`
            - For specific requests `axios.defaults.headers.post['Content-Type'] = 'application-json';`
    - Creating and Using Axios Instances with `const instance = axios.create({...});` and importing it
    as you would do a regular axios to the components
- Setting up and using Firebase
- About Routing and Router Package (which parses URL/Path, reads the config, and render/loads appropriate JSX / Component)
    - Packages `react-router` and`react-router-dom` (`react-router` alone can be omitted in the installation process
    because `react-router-dom` already wraps the former and therefore uses it as a dependency)
    - Wrapping app in `BrowserRouter` (there may be issues with imports, so remember to import it like 
    `import {BrowserRouter} from "react-router-dom";`)
    - Using `Routh` components with:
        - render `<Route path="/" exact render={() => <h1>Home</h1>`
        - path `<Route path="/" exact component={YourComponent} />`
        - `exact` tells you that the link not only starts with a given string, but it is truly a full link; without it
        the links that are only partially correct will also load its children components
        - a dynamic path with route parameters: `<Route path="/:id">...`
    - Using `Switch`:
        - it wraps all Route components and tells the app to load only the first route that matches one from the given list of Routes
        - it doesn't have to wrap all Routes, it can easily go like `<Route /><Switch><Route /><Route /></Switch`
    - Using `Link` components with:
        - regular string `<Link to="/">Home</Link>`
        - link builder with an object passed: `<Link to={{pathname: '/new-post', hash: '#submit', search: '?quick-submit=true'}}>New Post</Link></li>`
        - possibility to extract these values with `this.props.location.search` or `this.props.location.hash`
    - Using `NavLink`
        - which additionally sets the given link to `active` in html which helps with styling,
        - defining `exact` in NavLink which helps with setting up `active` class
        - changing active class name with `activeClassName='my-active-class'`...
        - ... or using defined styles with `activeStyle={{color: '#fff'}}`
    - Navigating programmatically with:
        - Regular Links, e.g. `<Link to={'/posts/' + post.id} key={post.id}>`
        - Pushing the new link `this.props.history.push('/' + id);`
    - Routing-Related Props with `history`, `location`, and `match` objects
        - Only the components that are loaded from the `Route` have access to these props by default
        - Passing these props to the lower components with `{...props`, explicitly targeting certain routes
        - Using a wrapper to the stateless components called `withRouter` from `react-router-dom` to gain access to these props for
        components that are not loaded from the `Route` object and are deep down the component hierarchy
    - Paths: Absolute (default) vs Relative (links that append your current path: 
    `<Link to={{pathname: this.props.match.url + '/new-post'}}>...`)
    - Nested Routes 
        - child components with the `Route` component (remember that the parent component can't be `exact`
        and needs the same starting link for example with `this.props.match.url + theRestOfTheLink`)
        - remember about `componentDidUpdate()` when the subcomponent is already loaded with data, otherwise
        it may not rerender
    - Redirecting with `Redirect` Component `<Redirect from="/" to="/destination" /> `
        - Using it to redirect conditionally with `{this.props.redirect ? <Redirect to="/posts" /> : null}` outside
        of the `Switch` component to automatically move to the new page
        - Using it programmatically with `this.props.history.replace('/');`, the difference between the `.push()` and
        `.replace()` is that you can go back to the previous page with `.push()`, but `.replace()` replaces the old page with
        the new page on the stack of pages so that the link stays the same (and you can't go back)
        - Using `this.props.history.goBak()` to go back a page
    - Guards - they don't really appear in React as you are just conditionally rendering page and can set any state
    to false so that a component is not rendered to the user, or the user is redirected
    - Accessing unknown routes:
        - can be used as `<Route render={() => <h1>Not found</h1>}/>` on the bottom of the `Switch` component so if it
        doesn't find any valid route, it renders "Not found" instead
        - can't be used together with `<Redirect from="/" to="/posts" />` as it also needs to be at the bottom of `Switch`
        component, so you need to decide if you want the one or the other
    - Loading Routes Lazily - you load only the components that you actually use.
        - Create a Higher Order Component (in the react-07-routing project, it's called the `asyncComponent`).
        This HOC is an unknown class which has a state and receives a function returning a component we want to render.
        It only triggers the render when we want it.
        - Whenever you are importing something from somewhere, you basically inform webpack (the build tool which 
        gets used behind the scenes) about this dependency, and it will include it in the global bundle, this is its job.
        - We don't want to include it in the bundle, want to load it when needed. Still, webpack needs to be able to 
        dynamically prepare some extra bundle for this potentially loaded code.
        - That's why we are conditionally importing the component we want to render with a function. Then, we pass this
        function to our asyncComponent, so that it can use the imports to make a render, for example:
        `const AsyncSomething = asyncComponent(() => import('./Something/Something'));` (example in `Blog.js`).
        It's called a dynamic import. It only uses the import if the constant AsyncSomething gets used somewhere.
        - Finally, we put this as a JSX code `{this.state.renderBool ? <Route path="/some-route" component={AsyncSomething}/> : null}`
        and we decide when we want it to display by changing our renderBool.
        - Behind the scenes, it creates new bundle `chunk.js` file that is outside of the main bundle `bundle.js` and gets
        loaded only if we need it (when we need our AsyncSomething component)
    - Lazy Loading with React Suspense 16.6:
        - We don't have to kill ourselves with the steps written above
        - Just switch your regular imports `import Something from './Something/Something';` ...
        - ... to the constant with call to import: `const Something = React.lazy(() => import('./Something/Something'))`
        - And Switch your regular Routing `<Route path="/" component={Something}/>` ...
        - ... to render it wrapped with `Suspense` component: `<Route path="/posts" render={() => 
        <Suspense falback={<div>Loading...</div>}><Something /></Suspense>`
        - `fallback` is something that is displayed if the React postpones rendering (it can also be a spinner)
        - It doesn't have to be used with Routes, it can also be used with regular dynamically rendered components that
        render when certain state is set
        - Supports only default exports
        - It's not supported with server-side rendering
    - Understanding that our real server needs to reroute user's call to load `index.html` and that we need
    to tell React about our base path in `<BrowserRouter basename="/my-app">...` if we start the app from the subdirectory
    (e.g. `https://some.website.i.made.up/my-app/`)
    - SearchParams - passing some properties in the URL
        - Setting search params in one component for multiple values using `encodeURIComponent()` method:
            - Using `encodeURIComponent()` method https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-url-encode-example-how-to-use-encodeuricomponent-and-encodeuri/
            - Creating an empty array, pushing values there (e.g. `queryParams.push(encodeURIComponent(i) + '=' + encodeURIComponent(this.state.something[i]));`)
            (helps with iterable) or `queryParams.push('price=' + this.state.totalPrice);`, joining it with `&` sign and sending to the search
            params: `this.props.history.push({pathname: '/', search: '?' + queryParams.join('&')});`
        - Retrieving it from the following component:
            - Getting it with `const query = new URLSearchParams( this.props.location.search );` (returns Iterable<string, string>)
            - Iterating over it `for ( let param of query.entries() )` and getting keys with `param[0]` and values with `param[1]`

- Redux (`redux`) - a standalone third-party library for managing the state of the application
    - Redux Docs: https://redux.js.org/
    - Core Concepts: https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts
    - Actions: https://redux.js.org/basics/actions
    - Reducers: https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers
    - Redux FAQs: https://redux.js.org/faq
    - State influences what you see on the screen. State management can be complex as your project grows.
    - Redux creates a Central Store which has the entire application state
        - It should be created before the application starts, so e.g. in `index.js`
        - `const store = redux.createStore(reducer)` creates a store; but this function should take a Reducer as a parameter
        - Usually, you create Reducers in the separate files, not in the `index.js`, because they contain
        a lot of code, so it's a good idea to contain them in a different file `reducer.js`, in a "store" folder
        - You connect Redux to React with the library `react-redux` and a `Provider` component
        - You wrap the app with it: `ReactDOM.render(<Provider store = {store}><App /></Provider>, ...);` and
        provide the store you created before
        - `store.getState()` gives you the current state of the store
    - Action is a pre-defined information package with a type (add, remove) and possibly with payload
    - Reducer receives action and updates State (but it can only receive synchronous functions, so e.g. 
    no http requests). It is the only thing that can update the Store. There can be multiple combined Reducers.
        - You decide what to do with different types of action while creating a Reducer, e.g.
        `const reducer = (state, action) => {if (action.type === 'SOME_TYPE' {return ... updatedNewStateObject;}}`
        - It doesn't work the same as `setState()` method which updated only the field that changed! Reducers return the new state
        of the application so any values or properties not set in a new state are deleted. However, we need to update the state
        in the immutable way, e.g. like this:
            - You start by getting into the action type you want to perform, either by `if(action.type === 'SOME_TYPE')` or
            by switch method `case 'SOME_TYPE'` or by creating constants in a given file and importing them as e.g. `import * as actionTypes from './actions'`
            - Inside, you make a copy of the object: https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/immutable-update-patterns/
                - the shallow copy with `const newState = Object.assign({}, state);` or `{...state}`; if you want to modify something
                on the fly here, you can use syntax  `{...state, someValuetoUpdate: newValue}` or if you have a string representation
                of the field name you can go with `{...state, ['someValuetoUpdate']: newValue}`
                - the deep copy with e.g. `const newState = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(state))` (this only works if your object does not contain: 
                Dates, functions, undefined, Infinity, RegExps, Maps, Sets, Blobs, FileLists, ImageDatas, sparse Arrays, Typed Arrays or other complex types)
                - or the deep copy with a third-party library such as `loadsh.cloneDeep` (preferred) or `jQuery.extend(true, { }, oldObject);`
                - more libraries:
                    - dot-prop-immutable https://github.com/debitoor/dot-prop-immutable
                    - immutability-helper https://github.com/kolodny/immutability-helper
                - you can use `previousArray.slice(0);` or `[...oldArray];` or `oldArray.filter(o => true)` to copy the array (but not the objects inside)
                - create some utility function e.g.
                ```
                export const updateObject = (oldObject, updatedValues) => {
                    return {
                        ...oldObject,
                        ...updatedValues
                    }
                };
                ```
                and use it to continuously e.g. 
                ```
                case actionTypes.INCREMENT:
                    return updateObject(state, {counter: state.counter + 1});
                ```
            - You update the fields and objects in the new state `newState.someValue = 'X'`
            - and ten you `return newstate;` which overrides the old state
        - You can set a default application state with `const initialState = {something: false}` and setting it
         up in Reducer if the state is null `const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {...}`
    - Then, Central Store triggers automatic Subscription that passes updated state (props to applicaton) to every component which subscribed to that Subscription
        - Components should somehow be connected with the Store and for React, the `react-redux` comes with the help
        of a function `connect` that returns a Higher Order Component
            - we pass there which part of the application state interests us in this component and which
            actions do we want to dispatch(we define this constants outside of the Component class and before export)
            - `const mapStateToProps = state => { return {componentProperty: state.someStateValue};}`
            for the application state; you call these properties with `this.props.componentProperty`
            - `const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => { return { doSomething: () => dispatch({type: 'SOME_TYPE'}) }; };`
            (or `const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => { return { doSomething: () => dispatch({type: 'SOME_TYPE', value: someValue}) }; };`
            if we want to pass some payload with the dispatch function) for the action to dispatch; 
            you call these actions with `this.props.doSomething` (when passed to the lower components)
            - wrap it in the export `export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(YourComponent)` (you can also
            use null for the mapStateToProps if you only have mapDispatchToProps, or you can just use the `connect` method
            with the first argument only if you only have mapStateToProps)
    - You can use multiple reducers:
        - in the `index.js` with `combineReducers()` method such as `const rootReducer = combineReducers({first: firstReducer, second: secondReducer});` 
        where both reducers are imported from two files in the 'reducers' folder; these reducers have some slice of the state which they need
        defined as an initialState
        - the names of the reducers are used to access the state, e.g. 
        `const mapStateToProps = state => { return { someValue: state.first.someStateValue, otherValue: state.second.oneMoreValue }};`
        - lookout for the reducers access to the state and initial state!
    - Types of State
        - Local UI State (Show / Hide Backdrop, Save input values to local values) - Mostly don't use redux, handle within components
        - Persistent State (All Users, All Posts) - Stored on Servers, relevant slice managed by Redux
        - Client State (is Authenticated? Filters set by User...) - Managed via Redux
- Advanced Redux with asynchronous code:
    - Middleware https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware/
        - Middleware is a term used for the functions or the code you hook into a process which then gets executed 
        as part of that process without stopping it. In Redux, we can place it right between your action being dispatched
        and it reaching the reducer.
            - In React, you define it as a function, e.g.
            ```
            const logger = store => {
                return next => {
                    return action => {
                        console.log('[Middleware] Dispatching', action);
                        const result = next(action);
                        console.log('[Middleware] next state', store.getState());
                        return result;
                    }
                }
            };
            ```
            - And apply it to the store `createStore(rootReducer, (applyMiddleware(logger)));` as a second argument, 
            with the `applyMiddleware` function which takes a list of middlewares
    - Redux Devtools 
        - Chrome installation: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=pl-PL
        - npm install https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-devtools-extension
            - add `const composeEnhancers = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ : compose;` to `index.js`
            (for using this composeEnhancers only in the development mode)
            - use `composeEnhancers` method to wrap middlewares `const store = createStore(rootReducer, composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(logger)));`
    - Action Creators is a function which creates (returns) a function
        - Create a function that returns a type of action: 
        ```
        export const increment = (value) => {
            return {
                type: actionTypes.INCREMENT,
                val: value
            };
        };
        ```
      (it can have a payload or be set without arguments)
        - Dispatch this function in the component: 
        `onIncrementCounter: (value) => dispatch(actionCreators.increment(value)),`
    - Asynchronous actions https://redux.js.org/advanced/async-actions with `redux-thunk` https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk
        - With a plain basic Redux store, you can only do simple synchronous updates by dispatching an action. Middleware extends the store's abilities, 
        and lets you write async logic that interacts with the store. Thunks are the recommended middleware for basic Redux side effects logic, 
        including complex synchronous logic that needs access to the store, and simple async logic like AJAX requests.
        - Redux Think Generally is a library which adds a middleware to your project which allows your
        actions to not return the action itself but return a function which will eventually dispatch an action. With this little trick,
        not returning the action itself but a function which will then dispatch one, we can run asynchronous code 
        because the eventually dispatched one part is the part which may run asynchronously.
        - Installation:
            - npm run `redux-thunk`
            - add `import thunk from 'redux-thunk';` (it is a middleware) and applying it while creating store
            `const store = createStore(rootReducer, composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(logger, thunk)));`
            - write action creator which will happen asynchronously:
            ```
            export const storeResult = someInput => {
                return (dispatch, getState) => {
                    dispatch(res => {
                        return {
                            type: 'SOME_TYPE',
                            result: someInput + 2
                        };
                    });
                }
            };
            ```
            where (call getState() to get the current/old state, also can be ignored and not put there) and of course with some logic inside
        - Example with everything installed:
            - Call a function when component mounts: `componentDidMount() { this.props.onInit();}`
            - Call the Action Creator in the mapDispatchToProps `const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => { return { onInit: () => dispatch(actions.init()) }}`
            - Define the Action Creator: 
            ```
            export const init = () => {
                return dispatch => {
                    axios.get('/some-link-here')
                        .then(response => {
                            dispatch(setDownloadedData(response.data));
                        })
                        .catch(error => {
                            dispatch(setFetchingDataFailed());
                        });
                };
            };
            ```
        - These action creators which run some asynchronous code are only possible due to redux-thunk and are caught in between,
          they never make it to the reducer, we only use them as a utility step in-between to run our asynchronous code which happens to be required
          to run on a lot of actions and then dispatch the synchronous action to change the state in the store.

- Writing simple unit tests
    - Required Testing Tools:
        - Test Runner - executes tests and provides validation library. It often emulates being in the browser environment.
        Test Runner uses this environment to execute our code.
            - `Jest` https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started https://jestjs.io/docs/expect https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-function-api
        - Testing Utilities - "simulates" the React app (mounts components, allows you to dig into the DOM).
            - `React Test Utils`
            - `Enzyme` (created by Airbnb) https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/ - `npm install --save enzyme react-test-renderer enzyme-adapter-react-16`
    - What to test?
        - Don't test the library
        - Don't test complex connections
        - Do test isolated units
        - Do test your conditional outputs
    - Writing tests:
        - Files should have *.test.js extension to be recognized as tests
        - `describe()` takes two arguments: first is a name of a tested component, second is a tested function
        - `it()` inside the tested function lets you write on single test, it also takes two arguments: first is a description
        of what you test/what should happen, and the second is the actual testing function. You can place as many `it()` functions
        as you want in the `describe()` function
        - `enzyme` lets you render standalone components without rendering the whole application; we enable it by creating
        the adapter at the top of our test file:
            ```
            import { configure } from 'enzyme';
            import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';
      
            configure({adapter: new Adapter()});
            ```
        - `shallow()` method lets you render the standalone component without its child components; if you have
        other components/containers used in the tested component, they will appear as placeholders, so that you don't render
        the whole subtree of components; it takes a component as an argument, e.g. `const wrapper = shallow(<NavigationItems/>);`
        - `expect()` method lets us define what we want to check; it combines with other methods which describe more precisely
        what kind of behaviour we expect
        - the example of a simple test:
            ```
            import React from 'react';
            
            import { configure, shallow } from 'enzyme';
            import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';
            
            import NavigationItems from './NavigationItems';
            import NavigationItem from "./NavigationItem/NavigationItem";
            
            configure({adapter: new Adapter()});
            
            describe('<NavigationItems />', () => {
                it('should render two <NavigationItem /> elements if not authenticated', () => {
                    const wrapper = shallow(<NavigationItems/>);
                    expect(wrapper.find(NavigationItem)).toHaveLength(2);
                })
            });
            ```
        - `npm test` to run the tests
        - for multiple `it()` test functions, you can use a `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` functions, to e.g. not multiple
        code for rendering a component
        - `wrapper.setProps({field: value});` helps you set the value dynamically in each test
        - of course, you can also send props into rendered  components, e.g. `const wrapper = shallow(<Button active/>);`
        or empty functions if there are needed some `const wrapper = shallow(<NavigationItems onInit={ () => {} }/>);`
        - if you need to test containers with some wrappers around them, you can e.g. add exports to
        only classes itself
        - if you need to test Redux, it's best to skip complicated dependencies between components. It's best to test the reducers themselves (as they are pure functions).
        You just apply different scenarios to the reducers and check if the result state is the one you expect:
            ```
            import reducer from './auth';
            import * as actionTypes from '../actions/actionTypes'
            
            describe('auth reducer', () => {
                it('should return the initial state', () => {
                    expect(reducer(undefined, {})).toEqual({
                        token: null,
                        userId: null
                    })
                })
            
                it('should store the token upon login', () => {
                    expect(reducer(
                        {
                            token: null,
                            userId: null
                        },
                        {
                            type: actionTypes.AUTH_SUCCESS,
                            idToken: 'some-token',
                            userId: 'some-user-id'
                        }))
                        .toEqual({
                            token: 'some-token',
                            userId: 'some-user-id'
                        })
                })
            })

            ```
          we don't need `enzyme` because we don't render any components if we just test the functions
- Deploying app to the web:
    - Deployment steps: 
        - Check and adjust basepath (discussed before)
        - Build and optimize the project `npm run build`
        - Server must always serve index.html (also for 404 cases)
        - Upload build artifacts to (static) server (in /build folder when using create-react-app)
    - The example of Hosting on Firebase 
- Working with WebPack: what happens behind the scenes https://webpack.js.org/concepts/
    - Webpack, simply, is a bundler, but actually: it is more than that. A bundler alone would just concatenate files. Webpack does that,
      but it also allows you to optimize your files and hook in various plugins and so-called loaders to also transform your files
      and for example transpile next generation javascript to current generation javascript. In its core,
      the idea behind webapck is to have multiple javascript, css, image, whatever files and bundle them together.
      It analyzes connections between these files like imports and then bundles everything together, allows you to optimize it,
      and also run some additional logic to transform your code or do whatever you need to do with it.
    - Behind the scenes, webpack has four important things/features:
        - It always needs at least one entry point(it could be `index.js` file that calls `ReactDOM.render()`).  
        It needs this file since it then analyzes the dependencies of this file. The root entry file will have a dependency to another file 
        which then in turn has more dependencies, so webpack can build up a dependency graph starting with that root entry file,
        so that it can understand which files make up our application. It then analyzes all the dependencies and bundles them together into an
        output we specify it like a `bundle.js` file in a dist folder, we specify the file name and where it should go.
        - In-between, there are two other important features we can utilize.
            - File-type dependent transformations: they are so-called loaders. Loaders are applied on a per file level, so we can for example say
            all javascript files should get handled by loaderX, all css files should get handled by loaderY.
            babel-loader and css-loader are two popular examples which get used in a lot of projects, so
            loaders are file dependent or apply file dependent transformations.
            - Global transformations: we also have plugins where loaders are applied on a per file basis, plugins
            take the concatenated files, so the bundle but before it's written to the output.
            Here we can apply some general transformations or optimizations like uglify,
            so this is on a global level and happens after the loaders did their job.
    - An example of creating your own project with designed-by-you webpack:
        - `npm init` to create package.json
        - `npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-cli` - webpack is building tool itself and webpack-dev-server
        is a development server we want to use so that we can test our application locally (`--save-dev` indicates that
        these dependencies are only available in the development)
        - create folders and structure of your app as you would see in your react app (folders assets, components, containers, and
        files such as index.js, App.js, index.html, index.css)
        - install production dependencies (such as react, react-dom, react-router-dom)
        - install babel for converting ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments
        `npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @babel/preset-stage-2 @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties` https://babeljs.io/
        - set up scripts in the `package.json` file, e.g.:
        ```
          "start": "webpack-dev-server",
          "build": "rimraf dist && webpack --config webpack.prod.config.js --progress --profile --color"
        ```
        - set up your basic webpack config https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/
            - create `webpack.config.js`
            - add to this file `module.exports = {};` to provide your configuration
            - inside this, you can define e.g.:
                - `entry` for the starting point of your application
                - `output` for where your files will go after build
                - `devtool` for how source maps are generating
                - `mode` e.g. development
                - `module` configuration object with rules, where you specify the file names and how the compiler
                shouild handle them
        - set up your .babelrc file. Here you specify all the presets the Babel presets you want apply to your code
        :
        ```
      {
          "presets": [
              ["env", {
                  "targets": {
                      "browsers": [
                          "> 1%",
                          "last 2 versions"
                      ]
                  }
              }],
              "stage-2",
              "react"
          ],
          "plugins": [
              "syntax-dynamic-import"
          ]
      }
        ```
      you are telling here "please compile my code so that it works in specified by me browsers".

- Next.js https://github.com/vercel/next.js/ and server-side rendering:
    - NextJs is a library building up on react. NextJS enforces a specific folder structure you have to use and gives you some things like server
      side rendering out of the box. Since you use that folder structure, it can manage a lot of things for
      you so that you don't have to configure them manually and therefore it can making the creation of react
      ups more convenient especially the server side rendering part.
    - Server side rendering simply means that when a user enters a URL leading to your react
      app or one of your pages of your react app, it will pre-render that page on the server so that the
      server returns that pre-rendered html code.
    - This structure takes advantage of enforcing a strict folder structure you have to use
      (though we're only talking about one folder mainly which has to be named in a certain way), so that all
      the routes of your application are actually generated automatically.
    - We don't use React router with Next.js to create routes and allow the user to visit /auth/user and so on.
      Instead, we create folders and files to reflect our URLs in the file system
      and Next.js, the package will automatically pass that and use its own internal router to handle all the heavy lifting.
      (e.g. if the component file is in the folder 'auth', the /auth path will lead to this page)
    - It pre-renders the content we load as pages on the server. It automatically splits the code (lazy loading), all of that out of the box without us configuring anything.
- Animations:
    - Regular css Transitions/Animations and two classes with two different states which will shift between each other. Each class
    is assigned to the component based on the props, e.g. `const classes = ['Modal', props.show ? 'ModalOpened' : 'Modal Closed'];`
    - Downside?  Component is always present in the DOM, exit animations are not possible
    - Using React-Transition-Group https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/
        - Animating elements when they are added or removed from the DOM
        - Using `Transitions`:
            - Wrap the component with the `<Transition>...</Transition>`component
            - Define `in` as boolean of when the component should be visible, and `timeout` as how long should the animation be played.
            - There are four stages of the transition: entering, entered, exiting, exited. `timeout` sets the time length of
            the entering and exiting states
            - Set booleans `mountOnEnter` and `unmountOnExit` if you want the rendered component to be added/removed from DOM on switch
            - Between the `<Transition>` component tags, we define the function that will render us a given component, e.g.
            `{state => <p>{state}</p>}` (in such example, the paragraph will display the string with the current stage's name)
            - Then, we set the styles of the child component, based on a state, e.g.:
                ```
                import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';
                
                const duration = 300;
                
                const defaultStyle = {
                  transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,
                  opacity: 0,
                }
                
                const transitionStyles = {
                  entering: { opacity: 1 },
                  entered:  { opacity: 1 },
                  exiting:  { opacity: 0 },
                  exited:  { opacity: 0 },
                };
                
                const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (
                  <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>
                    {state => (
                      <div style={{
                        ...defaultStyle,
                        ...transitionStyles[state]
                      }}>
                        I'm a fade Transition!
                      </div>
                    )}
                  </Transition>
                );
                ```
            - `timeout` can also take the object with two different values for entering and leaving, e.g.:
            `const animationTiming = { enter: 400, exit: 1000 };` and set it like usual `timeout={animationTiming}`
            - you can also set different events on `Transition`, based on its state, e.g.
                ```
                <Transition
                  in={this.state.showBlock}
                  timeout={1000}
                  mountOnEnter
                  unmountOnExit
                  onEnter={() => console.log('onEnter')}
                  onEntering={() => console.log('onEntering')}
                  onEntered={() => console.log('onEntered')}
                  onExit={() => console.log('onExit')}
                  onExiting={() => console.log('onExiting')}
                  onExited={() => console.log('onExited')}
                >...</Transition>
                ```
        - Using `CSSTransitions`:
            - Lets you attach predefined CSS classes to the given animation states. You define what classes (with what styles)
            will get attached to the component during certain state.
            - Example:
                ```
                <CSSTransition 
                    mountOnEnter 
                    unmountOnExit 
                    in={props.show} 
                    timeout={1000}
                    classNames={{
                        enter: '',
                        enterActive: 'ModalOpen',
                        exit: '',
                        exitActive: 'ModalClosed'
                    }}>...</CSSTransition>
                ```
              It's **classNames**, not className!
            - Each individual classNames can also be specified independently like:
              ```
              classNames={{
                   appear: 'my-appear',
                   appearActive: 'my-active-appear',
                   appearDone: 'my-done-appear',
                   enter: 'my-enter',
                   enterActive: 'my-active-enter',
                   enterDone: 'my-done-enter',
                   exit: 'my-exit',
                   exitActive: 'my-active-exit',
                   exitDone: 'my-done-exit',
              }}
              ```
            - These actions can be defined as:
                - Appear - when you want transition on component first mount (like when you refresh a page).
                - Enter - transition when a new element has mounted.
                - Exit - when element un-mounts.
            - You don't have to define all classNames. Simply, define a basic name, e.g. `classNames="fade"`. Then, the application will look
            for the classes corresponding to the given state, e.g. it will attach `fade-enter`, `fade-enter-active`, `fade-exit`, `fade-exit-active`, `fade-appear`, `fade-appear-active`.
            Then, it's just your job to define those classes in your application in the .css files.
        - Using `TransitionGroup`:
            - Can be used in places where you output lists so where you have a dynamic list of elements.
            - Does not define any animation behavior! Exactly how a list item animates is up to the individual transition component. 
            This means you can mix and match animations across different list items.
            - Example:
                ```
                render() {
                const listItems = this.state.items.map((item, index) => (
                  <CSSTransition key={index} classNames="fade" timeout={300}>
                    <li
                      className="ListItem"
                      onClick={() => this.removeItemHandler(index)}>
                      {item}
                    </li>
                  </CSSTransition>
                ));
                
                return (
                  <div>
                    <button className="Button" onClick={this.addItemHandler}>
                      Add Item
                    </button>
                    <p>Click Item to Remove.</p>
                    <TransitionGroup component="ul" className="List">
                      {listItems}
                    </TransitionGroup>
                  </div>
                );
                }
                ```
    - Different libraries:
        - React Motion https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion - tries to emulate real world physics to figure out the best timing an animation
        should take. It simply allows you to define end and starting states, and it tries its best to use
        this real world physics to emulate or to interpolate the state in-between.
        - React Move https://react-move.js.org/#/ - has two basic components which it exposes to you, which allow you to animate single items or groups of items, a node group.
          With react move, you always work with objects describing the state of an animation. It's closely connected to Three.js
        - React Router Transition https://github.com/maisano/react-router-transition - to animate page changing. It has AnimationSwitch component
        which replaces a regular switch component.
- Redux Saga:
    - You create Sagas which uses "kind-of-a" functions for side-effects
        - Syntax `function*` turns a regular function into a generator - next generation JS feature
        which are functions that can be executed incrementally. They do not run from start to finish but
        they can be paused for e.g. asynchronous code to finish.
        - In a generator, we should prefix, prepend step we execute with the `yield` keyword. 
        This simply means that this step should be executed and then it will wait for it to finish
        so if it were an asynchronous action, it wouldn't continue before the step is done.
        - The example of a Saga with different :
            ```
            export function* sagaToRunSaga(action) {
              yield delay(action.expirationTime * 1000);
          
              const token = yield localStorage.getItem("token");
          
              yield call([localStorage, "removeItem"], "token");
              yield localStorage.removeItem("someOtherToken");
          
              yield put(actions.callToOtherAction());
              yield put({ type: actionsType.ONE_MORE_ACTIO });
            }
            ```
        - It can have some argument `action` that has the same properties as dispatched actions
        - There are different functions in `redux-saga/effects` that you can use:
            - `delay` delays next action
            - every action should be started with `yield`
            - `call` allows you to call some function on some object; it's the same as calling some function
            but it helps you make this testable
            - `put` makes the call to the Action Creator previously defined or just calls some type of the action
        - Usually, you put Sagas in a different part of the application, so that they can be called
        but they are not formally a part of the synchronous calls
    - You need to register watchers in the Middleware in the `index.js` file:
        ```
        const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();
        
        const store = createStore(
            rootReducer,
            composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(thunk, sagaMiddleware))
        );
        
        sagaMiddleware.run(watchForSomeActionToRunSaga);
        sagaMiddleware.run(watchForOtherActionToRunSaga);
        sagaMiddleware.run(...);
        ```
    - These watchers are also generators that "watch for certain actions".
        - To run sagas when we want it, we need to use `takeEvery`. It will allow us to listen to certain actions and do something when they occur.
        - The example of such watcher (saga is without functions bracket!):
            ```
            export function* watchForSomeActionToRunSaga() {
                yield takeEvery(actionTypes.ACTION_WATCHED, sagaToRunSaga);
            }
            ```
        - You can also combine a few of the action types with `all`. 
        It instructs the middleware to run multiple Effects in parallel and wait for all of them to complete.
        It works best when you have two asynchronous tasks, and you want to run them simultaneously:
            ```
            export function* watchForSomeActionToRunSaga() {
                yield all([
                    takeEvery(actionTypes.ACTION_WATCHED, sagaToRunSaga),
                    takeEvery(actionTypes.SECOND_ACTION_WATCHED, secondSagaToRunSaga),
                    ...
                ]);
            }
            ```
        - There is also `takeLatest`. It will always take only the latest call for the action. For example,
        if there was a missclick double-click on some action from the user, it will automatically cancel any ongoing executions
        and always only execute the latest one.
            ```
            export function* watchForSomeActionToRunSaga() {
                yield takeLatest(actionTypes.ACTION_WATCHED, sagaToRunSaga),
                yield takeEvery(actionTypes.SECOND_ACTION_WATCHED, secondSagaToRunSaga),
            }
            ```
