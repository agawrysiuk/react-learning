# angular-learning

This project with Angular was created as a result of 
my Education Week at Altkom Software & Consulting.

To learn React, I used a 40hrs course on Udemy:

Things I learnt during that week:
- What is React
- What is included in the Next Generation JavaScript
- Components
- Passing values and methods with two-way binding
- Styling

### Modules created:
- **react-01-basics** - basics of creating a React application
- **react-02-assignment** - first assignment of creating two components with two-way binding
- **react-03-assignment-two** - second assignment on two-way binding with lists
