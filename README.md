# angular-learning

This project with Angular was created as a result of 
my Education Week at Altkom Software & Consulting.

To learn React, I used a 40hrs course on Udemy:

https://www.udemy.com/share/101WayBUUfcltRQno=/

If you thinking about learning React, I fully encourage you to take advantage of this course as it covers a lot of
ground rules and day-to-day frameworks that React uses, but also it's up-to-date, so it shows you the difference between
the old ways of writing React code and the new ways. Super important when you get tossed into an older project!

**Things I learnt during that week:**
- What is React
- What is included in the Next Generation JavaScript
- Components vs Containers (or Stateful vs Stateless)
- Passing values and methods with two-way binding
- Styling, Radium, Styled Components, and CSS Modules (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/)
- React Developer Tools in Google Chrome
- Error Boundaries
- Creation/Update Lifecycles https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html
- Components Lifecycle
    - `getDerivedStateFromProps()`
    - `componentDidMount()`
    - `componentWillUnmount()`
    - `shouldComponentUpdate()`
    - `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`
    - `componentDidUpdate()`
    - `PureComponent`
- Functional Components Lifecycle 
    - `useState()`
    - `useEffect()` https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html
    - `React.memo()`
- About Virtual DOM and how React updates the real DOM
- What you can return from `render()` method (Higher Order Components)
    - Higher Order Components https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html
        - JSX wrapped with root element (e.g. div) -> `return (<div></div>)`;
        - Adjacent JSX Elements (Auxiliary.js for Windows (as Aux is a reserved name), Aux.js for else),
            otherwise known as empty wrappers -> `return (<Aux>...</Aux>)` `const aux = props => props.children;` which act as a root element
        - React.Fragment -> also acts as a root element but is available since React 16.2 -> `return (<React.Fragment>...</React.Fragment>)`
        - Even newer version of React.Fragment, an empty tag that acts as a root element -> `return (<>...</>)`
        - other examples of Higher Order Components (names start with "With...") which are wrappers doing
        some work, e.g. WithClass technically is just a div with className but it can be written as:
            - a regular functional component (use when logic has something to do with HTML) 
            `const withClass = props => (<div className={props.classes}>{props.children}</div>);`
            which is used like `return (<WithClass classes={classes.Person}>...</WithClass>);`
            - or as a function (use when logic has something to do with running additional JS code)
            `const withClass = (WrappedComponent, className) => { return props => (<div className={className}><WrappedComponent {...props} /></div>);};`
            which wraps the class which is using it in the export, e.g. `export default withClass(Person, classes.Person);`
            so that way, we can set some Adjacent SJX Element as a wrapper `return (<Aux>...</Aux>)` and still have a higher wrapper with a className
    - An array of components created programmatically -> `return list.map(p -> return <P />)`;
    - An array of components/DOM objects typed -> `return [<div key="1"></div>, <p key="2"></p>, <P />]`
- PropTypes - runtime check for React props and similar objects. 
Used to document the intended types of properties passed to components. 
It checks props passed to the components against those definitions, and warn in development if they donâ€™t match.
https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html
- Refs - https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html a special property on any component which makes it detected by React. It can be used in several ways:
    - in Components
        - `<input ref={inputEl => this.inputElement = inputEl} ...?</...>`
        which can be called with `this.inputElementy.doSomething()`
        - from React 16.2, the most modern approach is to create a reference in constructor `this.inputElementRef = React.createRef();`,
        then signing it to some element `<input ref={this.inputElementRef} ...?</...>`, and finally, calling it
         by pointing to the current reference: `this.inputElementRef.current.doSomething();` in for example `componentDidMount()`
    - in Functional Components
        - by just creating a constant with React Hook `const toggleBtnRef = useRef(null);`, then
        signing it to some element `<button ref={toggleBtnRef} ...`, and finally, calling it
        by pointing to the current reference: `toggleBtnRef.current.click();` inside e.g. React Hook `useEffect()`
- Context - introduced by React and it helps us handle cases, where you need certain 
data, certain state in multiple components and you don't want to pass that state across multiple layers
of components just to get it from component A at the top to component D at the very bottom when the
components B, C in between don't really care about it. In short, Context is globally available
(or in the place you want to be available) JavaScrip object/array/variable. First, you create a js file with
the context `const yourContext = React.createContext({some: value, other: value}); export default yourContext;` (funnily enough,
we don't really care about the values here as we are going to use state) and then, there are three ways to use it:
    - as a JSX element with the syntax `<YourContext.Provider value={this.state.value}>...</...>` in the parent component where
    you set value, and the syntax `<YourContext.Consumer>{context => <child_components_here>}</...>` (function inside!) 
    in the component bottom child (in this example, we skip components B and C, and put it right into D).
    - with React 16.6, in the Components you can use a static property contextType (written exactly like this) and its value
    should match YourContext, like this: `static contextType = YourContext;`; then, you just use `this.context.value`
    (not this.contextType!) to get the values you need
    - in the Functional Components, you can use React Hook `useContext()` with the syntax `const yourContext = useContext(YourContext);`
    and then, use it inside the function by calling `yourContext.anyValueOrMethod`
- Sending Http Requests in React using Axios https://github.com/axios/axios
    - Should use `componentDidMount()` for HTTP requests
    - Using request and response interceptors for handling requests/responses and errors `axios.interceptors` https://github.com/axios/axios#interceptors
    - Using request and response interceptors in the wrapper anonymous class, withErrorHandler (with ejecting interceptors)
    - Setting up global configurations
        - Adding base URL with `axios.defaults.baseURL`
        - Adding default headers
            - For every request `axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = 'AUTH_TOKEN';`
            - For specific requests `axios.defaults.headers.post['Content-Type'] = 'application-json';`
    - Creating and Using Axios Instances with `const instance = axios.create({...});` and importing it
    as you would do a regular axios to the components
- Setting up and using Firebase
- About Routing and Router Package (which parses URL/Path, reads the config, and render/loads appropriate JSX / Component)
    - Packages `react-router` and`react-router-dom` (`react-router` alone can be omitted in the installation process
    because `react-router-dom` already wraps the former and therefore uses it as a dependency)
    - Wrapping app in `BrowserRouter`
    - Using `Routh` components with:
        - render `<Route path="/" exact render={() => <h1>Home</h1>`
        - path `<Route path="/" exact component={YourComponent} />`
        - `exact` tells you that the link not only starts with a given string, but it is truly a full link; without it
        the links that are only partially correct will also load its children components
        - a dynamic path with route parameters: `<Route path="/:id">...`
    - Using `Switch`:
        - it wraps all Route components and tells the app to load only the first route that matches one from the given list of Routes
        - it doesn't have to wrap all Routes, it can easily go like `<Route /><Switch><Route /><Route /></Switch`
    - Using `Link` components with:
        - regular string `<Link to="/">Home</Link>`
        - link builder with an object passed: `<Link to={{pathname: '/new-post', hash: '#submit', search: '?quick-submit=true'}}>New Post</Link></li>`
        - possibility to extract these values with `this.props.location.search` or `this.props.location.hash`
    - Using `NavLink`
        - which additionally sets the given link to `active` in html which helps with styling,
        - defining `exact` in NavLink which helps with setting up `active` class
        - changing active class name with `activeClassName='my-active-class'`...
        - ... or using defined styles with `activeStyle={{color: '#fff'}}`
    - Navigating programmatically with:
        - Regular Links, e.g. `<Link to={'/posts/' + post.id} key={post.id}>`
        - Pushing the new link `this.props.history.push('/' + id);`
    - Routing-Related Props with `history`, `location`, and `match` objects
        - Passing these props to the lower components with `{...props`, explicitly targetting certain routes,
        or wrapping child components with `withRouter` component from `react-router-dom`
    - Paths: Absolute (default) vs Relative (links that append your current path: 
    `<Link to={{pathname: this.props.match.url + '/new-post'}}>...`)
    - Nested Routes 
        - child components with the `Route` component (remember that the parent component can't be `exact`
        and needs the same starting link for example with `this.props.match.url + theRestOfTheLink`)
        - remember about `componentDidUpdate()` when the subcomponent is already loaded with data, otherwise
        it may not rerender
    - Redirecting with `Redirect` Component `<Redirect from="/" to="/destination" /> `
        - Using it to redirect conditionally with `{this.props.redirect ? <Redirect to="/posts" /> : null}` outside
        of the `Switch` component to automatically move to the new page
        - Using it programmatically with `this.props.history.replace('/');`, the difference between the `.push()` and
        `.replace()` is that you can go back to the previous page with `.push()`, but `.replace()` replaces the old page with
        the new page on the stack of pages so that the link stays the same (and you can't go back)
    - Guards - they don't really appear in React as you are just conditionally rendering page and can set any state
    to false so that a component is not rendered to the user, or the user is redirected
    - Accessing unknown routes:
        - can be used as `<Route render={() => <h1>Not found</h1>}/>` on the bottom of the `Switch` component so if it
        doesn't find any valid route, it renders "Not found" instead
        - can't be used together with `<Redirect from="/" to="/posts" />` as it also needs to be at the bottom of `Switch`
        component, so you need to decide if you want the one or the other
    - Loading Routes Lazily - you load only the components that you actually use.
        - Create a Higher Order Component (in the react-07-routing project, it's called the `asyncComponent`).
        This HOC is an unknown class which has a state and receives a function returning a component we want to render.
        It only triggers the render when we want it.
        - Whenever you are importing something from somewhere, you basically inform webpack (the build tool which 
        gets used behind the scenes) about this dependency, and it will include it in the global bundle, this is its job.
        - We don't want to include it in the bundle, want to load it when needed. Still, webpack needs to be able to 
        dynamically prepare some extra bundle for this potentially loaded code.
        - That's why we are conditionally importing the component we want to render with a function. Then, we pass this
        function to our asyncComponent, so that it can use the imports to make a render, for example:
        `const AsyncSomething = asyncComponent(() => import('./Something/Something'));` (example in `Blog.js`).
        It's called a dynamic import. It only uses the import if the constant AsyncSomething gets used somewhere.
        - Finally, we put this as a JSX code `{this.state.renderBool ? <Route path="/some-route" component={AsyncSomething}/> : null}`
        and we decide when we want it to display by changing our renderBool.
        - Behind the scenes, it creates new bundle `chunk.js` file that is outside of the main bundle `bundle.js` and gets
        loaded only if we need it (when we need our AsyncSomething component)
    - Lazy Loading with React Suspense 16.6:
        - We don't have to kill ourselves with the steps written above
        - Just switch your regular imports `import Something from './Something/Something';` ...
        - ... to the constant with call to import: `const Something = React.lazy(() => import('./Something/Something'))`
        - And Switch your regular Routing `<Route path="/" component={Something}/>` ...
        - ... to render it wrapped with `Suspense` component: `<Route path="/posts" render={() => 
        <Suspense falback={<div>Loading...</div>}><Something /></Suspense>`
        - `fallback` is something that is displayed if the React postpones rendering (it can also be a spinner)
        - It doesn't have to be used with Routes, it can also be used with regular dynamically rendered components that
        render when certain state is set
        - Supports only default exports
        - It's not supported with server-side rendering
    - Understanding that our real server needs to reroute user's call to load `index.html` and that we need
    to tell React about our base path in `<BrowserRouter basename="/my-app">...` if we start the app from the subdirectory
    (e.g. `https://some.website.i.made.up/my-app/`)
